# Future development

The application is pretty much ready. If I had more time, I'd write other algorithms
to use when optimizing the paths, since the current algorithm can be very slow when
the number of cities is large. The next algorithm I would implement would be
[cut-and-count](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0534.pdf), and after that, maybe some local
search to use when the input is too large for either of the exact algorithms.

# Usage

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar, visible on every page, has the options

* log in (Opens the log in page)
* register (Opens the registration page)

if you are not currently logged in, and

* log out

if logged in. By clicking the big "Path Optimizer Site" button, you can return to the index page.

## Index page

On the index-page, there are three lists of maps: all your maps, all public maps, and all maps visible to you with no non-default hexes.
The list of your maps is only visible if logged in.

The index page also has a link for creating a new map.

## New map creation screen

To create a new map, select its name, whether it is private or not, and its dimensions.
If a map is private, it doesn't appear on the front page. If it has no owner,
it is viewable with the ID, and if it has an owner, only that account can see it.

The name of the map must not be empty. The dimensions must be in the range [1, 10] for now.

## View map screen

Here you can see the details of the map, and edit it. There are four buttons,
and a hex grid (currently consisting of squares) representing the map. The four buttons are

* Save Map

* Edit Information

* Share

* Delete

Save map saves changes made to the hex grid. Edit information opens a spoiler where the name,
privateness and dimensions of the map can be changed. Share opens a spoiler giving information
on how to share the map, and Delete reveals another button, which deletes the map.

By clicking a hex in the the hex (square) grid, it's color changes. There colors are temporary
representations for hexes with cities, roads and nothing. Clicking the hex rotates its type
in the rotation nothing -> city -> road -> nothing. You can save changes by clicking the
"Save Map"-button. If you try to leave the page with unsaved changes, the site will ask you if
you really wish to do that.

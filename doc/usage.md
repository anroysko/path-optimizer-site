# Usage

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar, visible on every page, has the options

* log in (Opens the log in page)
* register (Opens the registration page)

if you are not currently logged in, and

* log out

if logged in. By clicking the big "Path Optimizer Site" button, you can return to the index page.

## Index page

On the index-page, there are two spoilers that open forms when clicked.

In the "Make a new map" spoiler, there is a form to make a new map.
You have to specify the name, width and height of the new map. These values may be later changed.

In the "Search for a map" spoiler, you can input the ID of the map you want to search for,
and then click search to search for it. Note that the map you are trying to view might not
exist or be visible to you.

## View map screen

Here you can see the details of the map, and edit it. There are four buttons,
and a hex grid (currently consisting of squares) representing the map. The four buttons are

* Save Map

* Edit Information

* Share

* Delete

Save map saves changes made to the hex grid. Edit information opens a spoiler where the name
and dimensions of the map can be changed. Share opens a spoiler giving information
on how to share the map, and Delete reveals another button, which deletes the map.

By clicking a hex in the the hex (square) grid, it's color changes. There colors are temporary
representations for hexes with cities, roads and nothing. Clicking the hex rotates its type
in the rotation nothing -> city -> road -> nothing. You can save changes by clicking the
"Save Map"-button. If you try to leave the page with unsaved changes, the site will ask you if
you really wish to do that.

Note that you might not have rights to edit a specific map, in which case none of the four buttons
exists, and requests that would be made by those buttons get refused. You might also have edit
permissions but not owner permissions, in which case you can save and edit the map, but not share
or delete it.

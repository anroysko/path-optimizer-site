# Usage

## Header

The header, visible on every page, has the options

* log in (Opens the log in page)
* register (Opens the registration page)
* index (Returns you to the index page)

if you are not currently logged in, and

* log out
* index

if logged in.

## Index page

On the index-page, there are two lists of maps: all public maps and all of your maps.
The list of your maps is only visible if logged in.

The index page also has a link for creating a new map.

## New map creation screen

To create a new map, select its name and whether it is private or not.
If a map is private, it doesn't appear on the front page. If it has no owner,
it is viewable with the ID, and if it has an owner, only that account can see it.

The name of the map must not be empty.

## View / Edit / Delete map screen

Here you can see the maps name, ID and whether it is private or not. You can
also change its name and privateness. The default values are the current values.
There is also an option to delete the map.
